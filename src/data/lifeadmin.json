  "description": "A mobile-first application designed to help users take full control of their financial obligations. Built with React Native and Expo, it provides a comprehensive solution for managing subscriptions, bills, insurance renewals, and recurring expenses — all in one place.",
  "platform": ["Mobile", "Android", "iOS"],
  "techStack": ["React Native", "Expo", "Context API", "AsyncStorage", "Firebase"],

  "overview": {
    "purpose": "Life Admin which is a Personal Finance & Renewal Tracker focuses specifically on renewal cycles and deadline awareness. It combines smart reminders, detailed analytics, secure local storage, and a guided multi-step entry flow to ensure users never miss a payment or renewal date again.",
    "targetUsers": [
      "Individuals managing multiple subscriptions and recurring bills",
      "Users who want proactive payment reminders",
      "People who prefer offline-first, privacy-focused financial tools",
      "Anyone tracking insurance renewals, rent cycles, or utility bills"
    ],
    "benefits": [
      "Renewal-First: Built around recurring cycles — subscriptions, insurance, rent, and bills",
      "Smart Reminders: Automated alerts at 30, 7, 3, and 1 day before every due date",
      "Offline-First: Works entirely on-device with optional cloud sync. No internet required",
      "Secure: Privacy-first design with encrypted local storage and biometric app lock",
      "Insightful: Analytics dashboard with monthly breakdowns and category-level spending insights"
    ]
  },

  "problem": {
    "summary": "Most people manage dozens of recurring financial obligations — monthly subscriptions, annual insurance renewals, quarterly bills, and rent cycles. Without a dedicated system, these deadlines live scattered across emails, paper documents, and memory. The result: missed renewals, unexpected charges, and unnecessary late fees.",
    "painPoints": [
      "Missed Payments: No centralized system to track upcoming due dates leads to forgotten renewals and avoidable penalties.",
      "Manual Reminders: Calendar reminders are static and require manual setup for every renewal — unsustainable at scale.",
      "Scattered Records: Bills, receipts, and renewal documents exist in different apps, folders, and inboxes with no unified view.",
      "Lack of Insight: Without analytics, users cannot identify spending patterns or anticipate high-expense months in advance."

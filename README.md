This portfolio is a high-performance, immersive web experience built with Three.js and React (Vite), combining modern frontend engineering with interactive 3D visuals. It showcases project documentation, technical architecture, and professional work in a visually engaging and structured format.

Designed as both a personal identity platform and a professional product showcase, the site delivers smooth animations, clean UI patterns, and responsive layouts powered by TypeScript, shadcn-ui, and Tailwind CSS. The experience blends immersive screens, interactive storytelling, and clear documentation to present projects from concept to implementation with clarity and depth.
